Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
1. Why are some temperature sensors not showing up?

TempsNow displays all available public sensor data on Apple Silicon. Some sensors are restricted by macOS and require an optional Apple-notarized system extension to access deeper hardware metrics.

2. Widgets are not updating. What should I do?

Ensure TempsNow is running in the background. macOS may pause widgets if the app is fully closed. Restarting the widget often resolves the issue.

3. Does TempsNow support Intel Macs?

No. TempsNow is designed exclusively for Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4 and newer).

4. What data does TempsNow collect?

TempsNow processes all temperature and system data locally on your device. No analytics, cloud storage, or external servers are used.

5. Is the system extension required?

No. The extension is completely optional and only enables access to additional restricted sensors if the user chooses to install it.

6. Will installing the extension affect macOS security?

No. The extension is Apple-notarized, safe, and operates within macOS's modern system extension framework.

7. My menu bar number disappeared. How do I fix it?

Go to System Settings → Control Center or Menu Bar & Dock, and ensure TempsNow is enabled in the status item list.
