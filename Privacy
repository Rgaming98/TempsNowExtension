TempsNow Privacy Policy

TempsNow does not collect, store, share, or transmit any personal data.
All temperature and system information is processed locally on your device and never leaves your Mac.

TempsNow does not use analytics, tracking, advertising, or third-party data services.
No user accounts are required, and no information is sent to any server.

If you choose to install the optional Apple-notarized system extension, it runs locally and does not send or receive any data.
It only enables access to additional device sensor information restricted by macOS.

If you have any questions, contact us at:
